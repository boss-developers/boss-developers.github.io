<div id="main">
	<p>Setting the right load order for your mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. BOSS can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.

	<p>While sorting, BOSS checks for load order errors such as incompatibilities and missing requirements, and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

	<p>BOSS's official support and discussion thread can be found <a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1515293-rel-boss-for-oblivion">here</a>.

	<p><strong>Using mods for Skyrim, Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas?</strong> Use <a href="http://loot.github.io">LOOT</a> instead, as BOSS's support for those games is relatively poor and no longer maintained. Oblivion users can also use LOOT, but may find that BOSS performs better, depending on the mods they use.
